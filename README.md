# Levy-Flight-Enhanced-PSO-Variants-for-Secure-Image-Encryption

🔒 Overview
This project evaluates Levy Flight (LF)-integrated Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) variants for chaos-based image encryption, comparing:

Standard PSO (SPSO)

Three LF-PSO hybrids (PSOLF-S1, PSOLF-S2, PSOLF-S3)

🔹 Key Findings:
✅ PSOLF-S1 outperforms SPSO in NPCR (99.62%), UACI (33.47%), and encryption speed.
✅ Chaotic logistic maps + LF-PSO enhance cryptographic key randomness.
✅ Entropy remains high (>7.99) across all variants, ensuring robustness against attacks.

📊 Performance Metrics Comparison
Variant	NPCR (%)	UACI (%)	Correlation Coeff. (CC)	Entropy	Time (ms)
SPSO	
PSOLF-S1	
PSOLF-S2	
PSOLF-S3	
*(Tested on 512×512 images; lower CC = better decorrelation)*

⚙️ Methodology
1. Chaotic Key Generation
Logistic maps generate initial cryptographic keys:

PSO optimizes control parameter (r) for maximal entropy.

2. PSO Variants
Algorithm	Description
SPSO	Standard PSO
PSOLF-S1	LF-driven global exploration
PSOLF-S2	Hybrid LF/local search
PSOLF-S3	Adaptive LF step sizes
3. Encryption Workflow
Key Optimization – PSO tunes chaotic map parameters.

Pixel Permutation – Chaotic shuffling of image pixels.

Diffusion – XOR operation with chaotic sequences.

🚀 Quick Start
1. Encrypt an Image
python
from psolf_s1 import PSOLF_S1  
from chaotic_maps import LogisticMap  

# Initialize  
chaos = LogisticMap(r=3.99)  
optimizer = PSOLF_S1(chaos)  

# Encrypt  
encrypted_img = optimizer.encrypt("lena.png")  
2. Evaluate Security Metrics
python
from metrics import calculate_npcr_uaci  

npcr = calculate_npcr_uaci(original_img, encrypted_img)  
print(f"NPCR: {npcr:.2f}%")  
🔐 Key Security Results
✔ NPCR > 99.6% – Minimal pixel correlation after encryption.
✔ UACI ~33.4% – Uniform pixel intensity changes.
✔ Near-ideal entropy (7.99) – Resists statistical attacks.

📜 Conclusion
PSOLF-S1 is optimal for image encryption, balancing speed and security.

LF improves exploration, escaping local optima in key space.

Chaotic maps + PSO = Robust encryption against brute-force attacks.
